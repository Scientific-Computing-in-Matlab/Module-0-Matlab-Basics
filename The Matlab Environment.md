# 1. The Matlab Environment

In this module, you will start to get familiar with the Matlab Environment.

## Objectives

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Customize the Matlab Desktop to your needs
- Find documentation on any Matlab related topic
- Use Matlab as a fancy calculator
- Use Matlab to graph some data

## Materials

There are many video tutorials that set the stage for working with Matlab. With all the video tutorials in this course, you will learn more by doing. So after viewing a tutorial once, open your own Matlab copy and play around with the commands introduced in the video.

Required
:
Lesson 1 on Coursera (The Matlab Environment)


Optional/Additional
:
There are many other videos covering similar material. If you find some of the Coursera descriptions confusing, YouTube has additional/alternative sources. If these YouTube videos fail to load, you can also view the videos from the Matlab program by typing ' demo' and then selecting the 'Working in the Development Environment'  and 'Getting Started' video.
Working in the Development Environment
Getting Started with MATLAB

Adam Panagos, from the University of Alabama at Hunstville, has created a whole set of introductory YouTube videos about Matlab.  
The Matlab Interface
Simple Calculations

Another useful resource is the Matlab Academy: you should register an account there (probably best to use a @xxx.rutgers.edu email; it should give you free access to the materials we use here).
