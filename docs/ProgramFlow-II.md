# Program Flow - II
This module builds on the Elementary Matlab and Program Flow modules: you continue to learn more ways to extract data from matrices and to write script and functions;Â the building blocks of analysis with Matlab.

Without loops, programs would be much less powerful, but complicated loops can also lead to bugs and code that is difficult to read or debug. Writing clean loops or avoiding some loops altogether leads to cleaner, faster code.

## Objectives

At the end of this module you will be able to:

- Manipulate arrays to find, extract, and replace data.
- Write functions and scripts
- Use or avoid loops

## Materials

Don't just watch/read, but try out the examples on your own computer. You learn by doing.
