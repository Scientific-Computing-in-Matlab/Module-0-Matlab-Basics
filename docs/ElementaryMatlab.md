# 2. Elementary Matlab

In this lesson, you learn how to represent your data using matrices in Matlab, and how to manipulate these matrices.

## Objectives

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Extract values from any matrix
- Find and change values in a matrix
- Reshape matrices
- Perform elementary mathematical operations on your numerical data

## Materials

Please note that just viewing or reading these materials is not going to be enough. You will only learn to code by coding. So, startup Matlab and try out the examples in the video/text as well as some variants that you come up with on your own. Practice, practice, practice.
