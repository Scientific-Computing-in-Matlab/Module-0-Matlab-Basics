# Program Flow - I

In this module, you will learn to write script and functions; the building blocks of analysis with Matlab.

## Objectives

At the end of this module you will be able to:

- Write well-formed functions, including help text, and documentation
- Decide when to use for- or while- loops
- Use conditional execution to solve complex program flow.
- Handle errors as they occur during script execution.

## Materials

Don't just watch/read, but try out the examples on your own computer. You learn by doing.
