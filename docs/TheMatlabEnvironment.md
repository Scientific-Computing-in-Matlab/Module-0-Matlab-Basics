# 1. The Matlab Environment

In this module, you will start to get familiar with the Matlab Environment.

## Objectives

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Customize the Matlab Desktop to your needs
- Find documentation on any Matlab related topic
- Use Matlab as a fancy calculator
- Use Matlab to graph some data

## Materials

There are many video tutorials that set the stage for working with Matlab. With all the video tutorials in this course, you will learn more by doing. So after viewing a tutorial once, open your own Matlab copy and play around with the commands introduced in the video.

### Required

- Lesson 1 on Coursera [The Matlab Environment](https://www.coursera.org/learn/matlab/home/week/2)

### Optional/Additional

There are many other videos covering similar material. If you find some of the Coursera descriptions confusing, YouTube has additional/alternative sources. For instance, from Adam Panagos at the  University of Alabama at Hunstville, who has created a whole set of introductory YouTube videos about Matlab.

- [Simple Calculations](http://www.youtube.com/watch?embed=no&v=iu4gba47DJg)

The Mathworks also provides many tutorial videos and demos to help you master all aspects of Matlab:
- [Matlab Academy](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/). If you use your @xxx.rutgers.edu email to register you should get free access to the materials we use here)
- [Matlab OnRamp](https://www.mathworks.com/training-schedule/matlab-onramp.html)
- Demos that you can start from the Matlab Command prompt (just start Matlab and type: `demo`).
