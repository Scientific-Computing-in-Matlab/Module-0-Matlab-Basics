# Module 0 - Matlab Basics

## Before the First Week

This course is aimed at students with some experience working with Matlab. To assess your skill level, or to brush up your skills, you should go through the Matlab Basics module. To help you decide whether you need to review  a specific section, here are the main topics, per section. Follow the links for details and materials.

Each Section has assignments to test your Matlab skills. When working on these, make sure to study the documentation (using the `help` or `doc` commands in Matlab) for each of the commands that you need (or that are suggested in the assignments). The help instructions often have "Related functions" at the bottom of the text; some of those could be relevant too, so browse around to improve your knowledge of Matlab commands.
