# Module 0 - Matlab Basics

## Before the First Week 
This course is aimed at students with some experience working with Matlab. To assess your skill level, or to brush up your skills, you should go through the Matlab Basics module. To help you decide whether you need to review  a specific section, here are the main topics, per section:

**The Matlab Environment**
:
 - Customize the Matlab Desktop to your needs
-  Find documentation on any Matlab related topic
- Use Matlab as a fancy calculator
- Use Matlab to graph some data

**Elementary Matlab**
:
- Extract values from any matrix 
- Find and change values in a matrix
- Reshape matrices
- Perform elementary mathematical operations on your numerical data

**Program Flow - I**
:
- Write well-formed functions, including help text, and documentation
- Decide when to use for- or while- loops
- Use conditional execution to solve complex program flow. 
- Handle errors as they occur during script execution.

**Program Flow - II**
:
- Manipulate arrays to find and extract data.
- Write functions and scripts
- Use or avoid loops 

Each Section has assignments. When working on these, make sure to study the documentation (using the help or doc command) for each of the commands that you need (or that are suggested in the assignments). The help instructions often have "Related functions" at the bottom of the text; some of those could be relevant too, so browse around to improve your knowledge of Matlab commands.
